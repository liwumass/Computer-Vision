# SELECTED PROJECTS in Deep Learning - Computer Vision
#### • Applied Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to do image captioning on Microsoft COCO.
#### • Implemented Vanilla RNNs and Long-Short Term Memory networks.
#### • Visualized the features of a pretrained model on ImageNet and then use this model to implement Style Transfer.  
#### • Trained and implemented a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce images that seem like a training dataset.
#### • Implemented vectorized backpropagation and several update rules to optimize Neural Networks.
#### • Implemented Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization for training deep networks.
#### • Implemented Dropout to regularize convolutional neural networks (CNN).
#### • Implemented image classification pipeline by using k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and SoftMax classifier.
